As part of course EC6131D

The following algorithms are given with codes and outputs

1. Gradient Descent
2. KNN(dataset IRIS)
3. Linear Regression
4. Logistic Regression
5. Naive Bayes
6. KNN(dataset Boston -- KNN not suited for this but was implemented)
7. Perceptron
8. SVM
9. Tree classifier
10. Backpropagation
11. Mobilenet (Project)

All the discussions regarding the code is written in the reports. Please look into the AIReport file for explanation regarding algorithms (1-10) and AI Project for explanation about 11 i.e mobilenet
